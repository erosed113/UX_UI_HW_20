  <p class="lead">This is a case study outlining my work redesigning the website of the non-profit Coats for Colorado!</p>
  <p class="lead">Coats for Colorado was designed to provide a platform where users could receive or distribute coats for those in need. We have observed that the non profit website isn’t reaching their intended target audience -- which is causing the owner to micromanage the distribution of coats to non profit partners and those in need. How might we expand the audience and provide more detailed information so that the nonprofit partners are able to efficiently meet their distribution goals while reaching a wider net to reach more needy Coloradans.</p>

                      For our teams research, we reached out to the President of Dependable Cleaners/Coats for Colorado, Steven Tolz. He was happy to talk to us at length about his goals, wants, struggles and successes. We learned a lot about who visits his current website (those in need of a coat) and those he would prefer to use his website as a tool to distribute coats (his team of over 120 non profit partners). He also expressed a desire to attract potential distribution partners to help connect the 47,000 coats he collects, cleans, and sorts each winter with the 120 nonprofits and their patrons. Major takeaways from this valuable information exchange: Coats for Colorado collects, cleans, sorts and makes over 47K coats available to those in need through a giving campaign from October-December each year. Their nonprofit network would benefit from a middleman who could support transport of coats to a wider net of those in need. Currently they reach primarily Denver metro, but would love to extend out to the entire State of Colorado. Partnering with a distribution team would alleviate some of the work Dependable Cleaners/Coats for Colorado needs to do to accomplish the huge task of getting coats to those in need. Making their website a tool for nonprofit partners to share location, current inventory, etc with those in need would be amazing. Sharing ways to participate in the program would be helpful. Expanding toolkits on the website would be beneficial (Coat Drives, NonProfit, possible creation of Coats for Schools Program). We also did a survey to gauge volunteering/support of local non profits via a Google Forms survey. Our findings showed the majority of respondents preferred to research giving on the internet, preferred to support a local nonprofit, and also liked to volunteer in a group setting. 
                      <img src="images/Research_Card.png" alt="..." width="100%">
                      So to show you a bit of our behind the scenes process in how we assessed our overall findings, we initially created a diagram so we could see all of the needs, wants, pain points and moving parts involved with what is not working on the current website -- and what we would need to accomplish in creating a more user focused redesign. With all of our research in mind, we began to brainstorm by using the  I Like, I Wish, What If diagram to explore all options.This exercise helped us get into the mind of our users by addressing current options that are out there based on our competitor analysis, as well as future improvements that our users would want to see. Finally we synthesized our data into a feature prioritization matrix to determine what would be the most impactful features to tackle for Coats for Colorado. We determined that the easy wins for the design would be to implement more information that helped visitors understand the “why”, behind Coats for Colorado, as well as creating resources that allowed visitors more accessibility to processes like hosting drives and obtaining coats for themselves. 
                      <img src="images/Research_Card2.png" alt="..." width="100%">
                      Ultimately, through all of our research and user feedback, our team settled on the following problem statement to address:Coats for Colorado was designed to provide a platform where users could receive or distribute coats for those in need. We have observed that the non profit website isn’t reaching their intended target audience -- which is causing the owner to micromanage the distribution of coats to non profit partners and those in need. How might we expand the audience and provide more detailed information so that the nonprofit partners are able to efficiently meet their distribution goals while reaching a wider net needy Coloradans.

                        Once we created our user flow to map out our site, we then began creating low fidelity wireframes that would be ready for user testing quickly, just to get that idea of what is going to work and what would need improvement. We knew the website would be more impactful if information was organized better; and with more graphics explaining the processes. We created the main page and relevant secondary/tertiary pages so that we could ensure that our entire process would be tested thoroughly.

                    We felt incredibly lucky to have been able to speak with the current President of Coats for Colorado, Steven Tolz. He was able to articulate his needs and what his goals were for the website. We were able to take that information and combine it with competitive analysis to create a website that is inviting, useful and a tool for Steven to attract future partners to take the organization to the next level. We also learned that testing, testing and more testing is really critical to a smooth user experience. We made changes throughout after multiple user testing sessions.
